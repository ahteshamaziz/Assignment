# Assignment

Assignment: Backend
You are building the API for a package-delivery company.

New users can be created, their information can be edited, and they can be deleted. We should store their name, email address, and street address.
Users can log in and log out by creating or destroying a JWT token.
When a user is logged in, they should be able to GET all the possible menu items (these items should be come from the Mongo Database).
A logged-in user should be able to fill a Details of package and delivery address deatils.
When an delivery order is placed, you should email the user a receipt. You should integrate with the sandbox of Mailgun.com for this. Note: Every Mailgun account comes with a sandbox email account domain (whatever@sandbox123.mailgun.org) that you can send from by default. So, there's no need to setup any DNS for your domain for this task. Read more here.
An API endpoint for the report of all orders.
Validation of all the request methods.
Image upload of every pakagae item.
Make documentation of all the API endpoints.
(Postman will be used for testing APIs, so make the postman collection and add it in the project folder then submit project to git).
